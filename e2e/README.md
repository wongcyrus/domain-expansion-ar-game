# Playwright gameplay E2E

The suite opens Viewer, Player 1, and Player 2 in isolated Chromium contexts.
It runs the production React applications and `WebSocketControlTransport`.
MediaPipe, camera/media devices, VFX, WebRTC, robot, and commentary boundaries
are deterministic browser mocks. Gesture frames enter through the mocked
MediaPipe `Hands.onResults` callback, then use the production
`StableGestureRecognizer` and `PlayerApp` scoring effects.

## Local

```sh
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e:local
```

Playwright starts `dev-server.mjs` with `E2E_TEST_MODE=1`. This only makes the
development server's gesture shuffle deterministic; normal development and
production builds are unchanged.

The repository-wide `scripts/test-all.sh` also runs this local browser suite.
CI installs Chromium and its Linux dependencies before running the script.

## Deployed AWS

Use an isolated test room and a temporary Cognito ID token:

```sh
E2E_MODE=aws \
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://frontend.example \
PLAYWRIGHT_WS_URL=wss://control.example/control \
PLAYWRIGHT_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example \
PLAYWRIGHT_COGNITO_ID_TOKEN='temporary-id-token' \
PLAYWRIGHT_COGNITO_TOKEN_EXPIRY='unix-seconds' \
PLAYWRIGHT_ROOM_PREFIX='CI42' \
npm run test:e2e:aws
```

`PLAYWRIGHT_API_BASE_URL` is optional. The token is injected into browser
storage and never written to source or reports. Use a short-lived dedicated
test identity and an isolated room-capable deployment. The suite does not create
Cognito users. Browser-side landmark fixtures cover every production gesture,
so deployed AWS challenge ordering does not need to be changed.

`PLAYWRIGHT_ROOM_PREFIX` is optional and defaults to `E2E`. It is uppercased,
non-alphanumeric characters are removed, and the result is limited to six
characters. Each room appends a two-character scenario code and a four-character
base-36 timestamp suffix, keeping the room at or below 12 characters while
allowing cleanup jobs to select only rooms from one run.

## Deployed AWS commentary

Trigger the real deployed Strands Local, AgentCore Runtime, and OpenClaw engines
through the authenticated REST API:

```sh
npm run test:commentary:aws
```

The test runs each engine sequentially, requires HTTP 200 and non-empty
commentary, verifies the reported engine, and prints response latency. It does
not attach webcam images or request Polly audio. Using the standard AWS SDK
credential chain, it reads `domainExpansionServerlessUrl` from the deployed
`aws-agentic-robotics` CloudFormation stack, loads Cognito IDs from the deployed
`config.json`, creates a temporary verified user, authenticates for an ID token,
and deletes the user in cleanup. The caller therefore needs
`cloudformation:DescribeStacks` plus Cognito permissions for
`AdminCreateUser`, `AdminSetUserPassword`, `AdminInitiateAuth`, and
`AdminDeleteUser`.

`COMMENTARY_ID_TOKEN` remains available as an override for environments that
must not create temporary users. `COMMENTARY_BASE_URL`,
`COMMENTARY_STACK_NAME`, and `COMMENTARY_AWS_REGION` can override deployment
discovery.

To trigger selected engines or change the client timeout:

```sh
COMMENTARY_ENGINES=openclaw,agentcore_runtime \
COMMENTARY_TIMEOUT_MS=65000 \
npm run test:commentary:aws
```
