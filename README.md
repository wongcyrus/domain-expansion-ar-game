# Domain Expansion AR Game

Independent React + TypeScript + Vite rewrite of the AR player, battle viewer, popup media player, and share gallery.

## Architecture

- `index.html`: player camera, MediaPipe gesture recognition, VFX, authoritative battle scoring, standalone solo rounds, configurable playback, and throttled robot calls.
- `battle.html`: authoritative room view, WebRTC streams, match controls, configurable rules/layout, score-grace cinematics, event commentary, browser/Polly TTS, the interactive Shizuku Live2D co-host, and results.
- `player.html`: origin-validated popup media surface.
- `share.html`: resolved snapshot images, download, and Web Share/clipboard actions.
- Player, battle, result, and Scroll of Honor UI supports English, Hong Kong
  Traditional Chinese, Taiwan Traditional Chinese, and Japanese.
- `src/core/protocol.ts`: typed Zod wire protocol with runtime validation.
- `src/services/controlTransport.ts`: native WebSocket control transport.
- `src/services/webrtcSession.ts`: isolated WebRTC signaling/session service.
- `dev-server.mjs`: localhost online coordinator with deadline-based match state.

Battle mode is **WebSocket-authoritative only**. It contains no
`BroadcastChannel`, same-browser local coordinator, or Socket.IO fallback.
Multiple tabs can still be used for development, but they communicate through
the WebSocket coordinator exactly like separate devices. The standalone solo
mini-game remains available on the player page and does not emulate a
multiplayer coordinator.

The WebSocket wire format is protocol `2.0`: the client joins with
`{action:"join",roomId,role,clientId}`, wraps authoritative commands in
`{action:"command",envelope}`, and sends WebRTC negotiation with
`{action:"signal",roomId,to?,signalType,payload}`. Server events are validated
envelopes, including `room.snapshot` and `webrtc.*`.

Starting a match enters the authoritative `preparing` phase while START
snapshots and opening commentary are produced. The viewer that issued
`match.start` may send `match.beginCountdown` only after opening TTS playback
finishes; the countdown deadline is created at that point, so gameplay cannot
start underneath the introduction.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

- `https://localhost:5173/battle.html?room=BTL1`
- `https://localhost:5173/?room=BTL1&role=player1`
- `https://localhost:5173/?room=BTL1&role=player2`

The development server automatically reuses `cert.pem` and `key.pem` from the
V1 project when they are available. The local WebSocket URL follows the page
protocol, so HTTPS uses `wss://localhost:5173/control`. It also provides
same-origin local snapshot upload/download endpoints so the embedded Scroll of
Honor can display both player captures without a separate REST server.

Local AI commentary uses Amazon Bedrock through the AWS SDK credential chain.
Sign in with the AWS CLI before starting the server. The defaults match the
deployed commentator, and can be overridden when needed:

```bash
aws sso login --profile your-profile
AWS_PROFILE=your-profile \
BEDROCK_REGION=us-east-1 \
BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=global.moonshotai.kimi-k3 \
COMMENTARY_MAX_TOKENS=1600 \
POLLY_REGION=us-east-1 \
LOCAL_COMMENTARY_LAMBDA=optional-deployed-function-name \
npm run dev
```

The AWS credentials remain in the Node development server and are never sent
to the browser. When AWS TTS is selected, local mode synthesizes Amazon Polly
MP3 audio in memory and returns it directly to the browser; it does not require
an S3 bucket. If direct access to the Polly endpoint is unavailable, local mode
automatically invokes the deployed Domain Expansion backend Lambda and uses
its presigned Polly audio. `LOCAL_COMMENTARY_LAMBDA` avoids automatic Lambda
discovery when supplied. The AWS identity therefore needs
`bedrock:InvokeModel`, `polly:SynthesizeSpeech`, and, for the fallback,
`lambda:ListFunctions` plus `lambda:InvokeFunction`. If both Polly paths fail,
the UI displays the error and falls back to browser speech.

To use different certificates:

```bash
VITE_HTTPS_CERT=/absolute/path/to/cert.pem \
VITE_HTTPS_KEY=/absolute/path/to/key.pem \
npm run dev
```

Do not commit private keys. When no certificate pair is available, the server
falls back to HTTP and prints the resulting URL.

Endpoint and Cognito values may be overridden without editing `config.json`:

```bash
VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://example.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/prod \
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com \
VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=region_pool \
VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=client-id \
VITE_COGNITO_REGION=region \
npm run dev
```

## Deployed backend endpoints

Replace `public/config.json` at deployment time:

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": "2.0",
  "webSocketUrl": "wss://example.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/prod",
  "apiBaseUrl": "https://example.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/prod",
  "defaultRoomCode": "BTL1",
  "defaultSessionKey": "mcpserver",
  "cognitoUserPoolId": "region_pool",
  "cognitoUserPoolClientId": "client-id",
  "cognitoRegion": "region"
}
```

The API client explicitly adds a stored Cognito ID token to its own requests. It never patches global `fetch`. Supported surfaces are `/api/register-room`, `/api/trigger-technique`, `/api/live-status`, `/api/battle-result`, `/api/webcam-upload`, and `/api/get-snapshot`.

The production WebSocket coordinator must implement the schemas in `src/core/protocol.ts`. WebRTC media is peer-to-peer; only offers, answers, and ICE candidates use the control socket.

## Validation

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```
